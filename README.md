# DEBLOGGER

A simple, fully-functional, decentralized content sharing web application, which implements a public blockchain from scratch, and the Flask web framework with Jinja2 templating.

Objective: to build a simple web application using a public blockchain that allows users to share information over a decentralized network.
Because the content will be stored on the blockchain, it is immutable and permanent (more below).
An explicit definition of the structure of the data (posts) that will be stored on the blockchain:
A post is a message posted by any user on the web application, it must have three properties: content, author, and timestamp.

Using the Flask web microframework, create endpoints for different functions of the blockchain, such as adding a transaction.
Then, run the scripts on multiple machines in order to create a decentralized network.
Build a simple UI with Flask and Jinja2 templating that interacts with the blockchain and stores information for any use case.
For instance, content sharing, P2P payments, chatting, or e-commerce.
